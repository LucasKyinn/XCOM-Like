## Developped as a part of my second year of master degree
 
**Subject** 

The goal of this project is to build the foundations of a third-person turn-based tactical game (TBS game). The game can take place in a medieval, modern, or science-fiction universe. The elements of the game are as follows:

    -The game must contain two opposing teams, with three units each
    -The units must be different (e.g. melee, range, healer, etc.)
    -The game must contain at least one indoor and one outdoor room
    -The rooms must be lit by various sources
    -The rooms must contain obstacles, doors and/or windows
    -The possible movements must be visible
    -The players' actions must include attack, defense, movement, and overwatch.
    -Health and action points must be managed.

Note: it is recommended to draw inspiration from the game XCOM (or XCOM 2) and to simplify the framework.

**Objective I**

    -Construction of the rooms.
    -Quality and number of assets: the rooms must contain various objects (doors, windows, blocks). Some objects can be dynamic (e.g. open door).
    -Quality of lighting and shading: the rooms must contain various sources of light.

**Objective II**
    
    -Construction of a team of three units.
    -Quality of units: diversity of characters.
    -Quality of collisions: characters cannot pass through objects (except open doors).
    -Quality of movements: the possible movements of characters must be visible.
    -Quality of actions: the various actions of the characters must be visible.

**Objective III**

    -Construction of the opposing team.
    -Management of health and action points.
    -The teams must have opposite starting zones.
    -The possible movements of the characters must include danger or opportunity zones.
    -At the end of each action point, the overall result must be calculated and visualized.
