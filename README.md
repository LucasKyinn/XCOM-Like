## Developped as a part of my second year of master degree
 
** subject  ** 

The goal of this project is to build the foundations of a third-person turn-based tactical game (TBS game). The game can take place in a medieval, modern, or science-fiction universe. The elements of the game are as follows:
● The game must contain two opposing teams, with three units each
● The units must be different (e.g. melee, range, healer, etc.)
● The game must contain at least one indoor and one outdoor room
● The rooms must be lit by various sources
● The rooms must contain obstacles, doors and/or windows
● The possible movements must be visible
● The players' actions must include attack, defense, movement, and overwatch.
● Health and action points must be managed.
Note: it is recommended to draw inspiration from the game XCOM (or XCOM 2) and to simplify the framework.
Objective I
● Construction of the rooms.
● Quality and number of assets: the rooms must contain various objects (doors, windows, blocks). Some objects can be dynamic (e.g. open door).
● Quality of lighting and shading: the rooms must contain various sources of light.
Objective II
● Construction of a team of three units.
● Quality of units: diversity of characters.
● Quality of collisions: characters cannot pass through objects (except open doors).
● Quality of movements: the possible movements of characters must be visible.
● Quality of actions: the various actions of the characters must be visible.
Objective III
● Construction of the opposing team.
● Management of health and action points.
● The teams must have opposite starting zones.
● The possible movements of the characters must include danger or opportunity zones.
● At the end of each action point, the overall result must be calculated and visualized.
